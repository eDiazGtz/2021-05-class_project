 Week 5 Day 2 -- Login and Registration

1) Delete/Destroy revisited
    -<a> vs <form>
    -change to form && protect from GET requests
    -How to make Form Submit Button look like link? CSS (not gonna demo this)

2) Registration --- just creating a User with Validations
    -Regular Expression Validations (so far, using only for EMAIL)
        -import re (regular expression library)
        -regex101.com --- recommended resource (regex is HARD y'all)
    -Multiple Validation Methods (and why!)
    -Bcrypt library
        -Trust No One! Hashing and Hiding information is good to hide from Databases/Companies/Hackers
        -pip install bcrypt
        -Encodes User input -> Salts (adds mumbo-jumbo chars) -> Decodes to be in a jumbled state in DB
    -Using session

3) Login --- more of a Validation that ♫ you are who you say you are... a superstar... then have no fear, Log-in is here ♪
    -Process of a Login
    -Uniqueness Validation & Password 
        -Encode Password input -> Salts -> now can be compared to Encoded saved string from DB.
    -Logout & Permissions
